# Introduction

## Package Description


# Exploratory Data Analysis
Our data can be loaded using the `load_crimes_API()` function from the `chicri` package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- load_crimes_API(year = NULL)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
df<- read_csv("~/Desktop/project/data_API.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
df <- df %>% long_variables()
```

## Variables to Keep

# Predicting Crimes Spatially and Temporally 
For this task we implement a general additive model (GAM) using the `gam()` function from the `mvgc` package.

## Weekly and Monthly Predictions

We use the `count_cases()` function to obtain weekly and monthly counts
```{r}
week_data <- df %>% count_cases(date_level = "week")


```
